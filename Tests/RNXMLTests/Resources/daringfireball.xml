    <summary type="text">GM’s $20–25 billion target for services revenue by 2030 feels like a Kendall Roy number — plucked out of thin air by someone just making up figures in an Excel spreadsheet until they get the SUM() result they’re looking for.</summary>
    <content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/09/gm-hires-ex-apple-exec-mike-abbott-to-lead-new-software-unit.html">Michael Wayland, reporting last week for CNBC</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>General Motors has hired former Apple executive Mike Abbott to
lead a newly created software unit for the Detroit automaker.
Abbott, former vice president of engineering for Apple’s cloud
services division, will join GM as executive vice president of
software, effective May 22. He will report to GM CEO Mary Barra.</p>

<p>Abbott’s newly created role will bring together three separate
functions within the company: software-defined vehicle and
operating systems; information and digital technology; and the
company’s digital business. [...]</p>

<p>GM has a target to grow profit margins and double its revenue to
about $280 billion by the end of this decade. That includes
significant growth in new business units and software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not familiar with Mike Abbott, but it sounds like his expertise is entirely in cloud services, not user-facing software design and engineering. So I don’t think Barra was thinking “<em>Apple makes great software that people love, so we should hire someone from Apple who knows how to lead such a team</em>”,<sup id="fnr1-2023-05-16"><a href="#fn1-2023-05-16">1</a></sup> but instead more like “<em>Apple has built an $80 billion per year services division that continues to grow each quarter, so we should hire someone who knows how to lead such a team</em>”. Barra is looking at <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/05/apple-q2-2023-results-94-8b-revenue-better-than-expected/">Apple’s services revenue</a>, not the quality of Apple’s CarPlay.</p>

<p>That’s fine, and maybe someone like Abbott is exactly who GM needs. But I don’t look at this hire and think that GM is any more likely to come up with a CarPlay-quality interface for its own platform.</p>

<p>Anyway, this news is as good an excuse as any to break out some back-of-the-envelope math on Barra’s services revenue goals for GM. When <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/gm_carplay_iphones">GM announced they were dropping CarPlay from their EVs</a> last month, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/gm-plans-phase-out-apple-carplay-evs-with-googles-help-2023-03-31/">Reuters reported</a> that “Barra is aiming for $20 billion to $25 billion in annual revenue from subscriptions by 2030.”</p>

<p>That seems very ambitious.</p>

<p>Let’s look at GM’s current subscription services revenue. <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/07/24/why-wall-street-loves-this-new-car-option-that-dri/">Here’s Larry Printz, writing for Motley Fool last July</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to company officials, GM generated nearly $2 billion in
subscription services revenue and EBIT margins north of 70% in
fiscal 2021. The automaker currently has more than 4 million
subscribers. For 2021, GM’s global revenue was $127 billion,
meaning that if forecast proved true, OnStar accounted for 1.6% of
GM’s worldwide revenue. While that may seem like a minimal
contribution to the bottom line, that figure should grow thanks to
recent additions to OnStar.</p>

<p>GM recently announced a subscription plan for its SuperCruise
self-driving feature, which is free for the first three years on
new vehicles. It also opened OnStar to owners of non-GM vehicles
through a smartphone app, which should bring additional
subscribers — and income.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To grow from $2 billion to $20 billion (the low end of Barra’s stated goal) by 2030, it seems safe to assume she’s expecting this growth to come from future car sales, not GM vehicles that are already on the road today.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/225326/amount-of-cars-sold-by-general-motors-worldwide/">GM sells about 6 million vehicles per year</a> — but that number has been declining since a peak of 10 million in 2016. Presumably, these future services will require vehicles equipped with GM’s new software platform. Right now they’re claiming this system will only be going into EVs, and in 2022, <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/629611/us-gm-plugin-car-sales-2022q4/">only 1.7 percent of GM vehicles sold were all-electric</a>.</p>

<p>So let’s be generous and say that by 2030, GM has sold 30 million vehicles eligible for <em>and subscribed to</em> the company’s new services. I think 30 million is very generous — if not outlandish — and would require them to put the new software platform in their gas and hybrid vehicles, too. Keep in mind they only had 4 million subscribers in 2021 and their vehicle sales are in decline.</p>

<p>$20 billion in revenue from 30 million subscribers = $666/year/vehicle = $55/month/vehicle. That’s in line with their current average of $500/year per services subscriber ($2 billion in revenue from 4 million subscribers, per Motley Fool above), but it’s a lot of money per subscriber. I just don’t see how they grow from 4 million subscribers today to 30 million or more by 2030.</p>

<p>What services could they offer that new car buyers would pay north of $50/month for? Maps and navigation? Everyone has that on their phones already. Music and podcasts? Everyone has that on their phones already. Crash detection? By 2030 everyone will have that on their phones already (or at least they will <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213225">if they have iPhones</a>, but I bet that will soon become a standard feature on Android phones too). GM wants to sell “behavior based insurance” (translation: tracking/surveillance), but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-set-launch-behavior-based-us-driver-insurance-q1-executive-2022-01-24/">according to Reuters</a>, their goal for insurance is just $6 billion/year by 2030. I find it hard to see where the rest of the money will come from.</p>

<p>GM executives might be dreaming that car buyers will pay GM for services they already get on their phones by not supporting CarPlay and Android Auto, but today’s reality shows that people will just buy $5 mounts to attach their phones to their vehicle’s dashboard. And if every other automaker continues to support CarPlay and Android Auto, it just seems like this entire endeavor will turn into an expensive boondoggle that steers would-be GM buyers to other brands.</p>

<p>One idea that occurred to me is the equivalent of Apple’s services revenue dark matter: payments from Google for default placement as Safari’s search engine. Neither Apple nor Google have ever disclosed those numbers, but <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/05/apple-default-search-engine/">one recent estimate</a> pegs it at $20 billion per year. At a minimum, it’s $10 billion per year. Those payments from Google go into “Services” in Apple’s quarterly results. Apple now reports $20 billion in services revenue per <em>quarter</em> — so most of that is coming from customer subscriptions to things like iCloud Plus, Apple Music, etc., but somewhere around 20-25 percent of it comes from Google paying to be the default search engine in Safari. With GM’s upcoming in-house software system not supporting CarPlay or Android Auto, but made in partnership with Google (based on Google’s confusingly-named <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/devices/automotive/start/what_automotive">Android Automotive</a> platform) presumably Google Maps (and/or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23499734/google-maps-waze-development-teams-combined-productivity">Waze</a>?) will be the one and only choice for mapping and navigation, and perhaps Google will pay GM for that privilege? And for default placement for other services like music? Even if that’s the deal, though, I don’t see how it gets GM close to $20 billion in services revenue per year. Apple gets $15-20 billion from Google for default search engine placement in Safari on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253162/iphone-users-total-number-billion-apple-tim-cook-q1-2021">over one billion</a> iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Even my kindest, most optimistic estimate pegs eligible GM vehicles at just 30 million by 2030. Would Google pay GM 30–40 times more per car to provide the default mapping app than they pay Apple per iPhone/iPad/Mac? That doesn’t make sense to me, but I supposed it’s theoretically possible that mapping surveillance data is <em>that</em> valuable to Google. I really fucking doubt it, though.</p>

<p>The one and only thing I can think of that GM can charge a subscription for that drivers can’t get via their phones is semi-autonomous driving. GM calls this Super Cruise and <a href="https://www.onstar.com/plans/premium">currently charges $25/month for it</a>, or $15/month for drivers who also subscribe to OnStar. (OnStar offers roadside assistance and crash detection — which, again, everyone will have for free with their phones by 2030.) But Super Cruise could exist as a standalone subscription feature <em>alongside</em> support for CarPlay and Android Auto — and in fact does today. Charging a subscription fee for Super Cruise doesn’t require GM to drop support for CarPlay and Android Auto integration.</p>

<p>I can’t see how these ballpark numbers make any sense. It’s an enormous bet against the primacy of the phone in people’s lives, with no one yet, in any industry, ever having won a bet against the phone. GM’s $20–25 billion target for services revenue by 2030 feels like a <a href="https://succession.fandom.com/wiki/Kendall_Roy">Kendall Roy number</a> — plucked out of thin air by someone just making up figures in an Excel spreadsheet until they get the <code>SUM()</code> result they’re looking for.</p>

<p>Jim Newell, writing for Slate under the headline “A Brief, Concerning Conversation With Dianne Feinstein”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I asked her how she was feeling.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m feeling fine. I have a problem with the leg.” A
fellow reporter staking out the elevator asked what was wrong
with the leg.</p>

<p>“Well, nothing that’s anyone concern but mine,” she said.</p>

<p>When the fellow reporter asked her what the response from her
colleagues had been like since her return, though, the
conversation took an odd turn.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t been gone,” she said.</p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>“You should follow the — I haven’t been gone. I’ve been working.”</p>

<p>When asked whether she meant that she’d been working from home,
she turned feisty.</p>

<p>“No, I’ve been here. I’ve been voting,” she said. “Please. You
either know or don’t know.”</p>

<p>After deflecting one final question about those, like Rep. Ro
Khanna, who’ve called on her to resign, she was wheeled away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feinstein’s months-long absence from the Senate has been one of the biggest political stories of the year. Her senescence is truly sad at a personal level, but the U.S. Senate, ostensibly the greatest deliberative body in the history of democracy, is no place for a person who doesn’t know where she’s been for the last three months. Anyone on her staff or in her family who isn’t urging her to resign ought to be ashamed.</p>

<p>Lillian Rizzo, reporting for CNBC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NBCUniversal global advertising chief Linda Yaccarino has resigned
to join Twitter as its next chief executive. Twitter owner Elon
Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1657050349608501249">confirmed the hire</a> in a tweet Friday.</p>

<p>“I am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of
Twitter!” Musk tweeted. He said she “will focus primarily on
business operations, while I focus on product design &amp; new
technology.”</p>

<p>He added, “Looking forward to working with Linda to transform this
platform into X, the everything app.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wish Yaccarino luck, truly. But the CEO needs to run the company, and I find it unlikely that she’s going to have that authority with Musk running “product design and new technology”.</p>

<p>Tim Cook is an obvious example of a non-product person who is very successfully leading a product-first company. But while Cook is not a product designer or product visionary, there is zero question within Apple that Cook is the boss. The buck stops at Cook’s desk — including on product decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.bsky.social/post/3jup7lhivok25">noticed</a> about two weeks ago that Musk has largely stopped referring to Twitter by name and instead saying “<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1652048146195959809">this platform</a>”. Months ago he <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-inc-changes-its-name-to-x-corp-and-moves-to-nevada-703ac892">changed the name of the holding company</a> from “Twitter Inc.” to “X Corp.”. The fact that he largely refers to it now as “this platform” makes me think he’s going to rename it X sooner rather than later. Seems crazy to me to throw away the Twitter brand name though, so maybe “X” will just be to Twitter what “Meta” is to Facebook and “Alphabet” is to Google. But also: Musk does crazy things. Throwing away the entire Twitter brand would be less crazy than his buying it in the first place.</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Tim Hardwick, writing for MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a brief report posted to <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/apple-ar-mr頭戴裝置發佈預測與供應鏈投資策略-高偉電子為最大受益者-apple-ar-mr-headset-announcement-prediction-and-supply-e44e3bbecb77">Medium</a> on Monday, Kuo wrote
that the headset’s announcement next month “bodes well” for the
supply chain share price, with the analyst touching on five of the
device’s components that — apart from assembly — represent its
“most expensive material costs” in his view.</p>

<p>Those include the 4K micro-OLED displays, dual M2-based
processors, the headset casing, 12 optical cameras for tracking
hand movements, and the external power supply. These components
are being supplied by Sony, TSMC, Everwin Precision, Cowell, and
Goretek, respectively.</p>

<p>Pricing on the headset is expected to begin somewhere around
$3,000. Perhaps with that in mind, Apple won’t aim it at general
consumers to start with, but will instead position it as a device
for developers, content creators, and professionals. Apple expects
to sell just one headset per day per retail store, and it has told
suppliers that it expects sales of seven to 10 million units
during the first year of availability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kuo doesn’t mention the purported $3,000 price in his report, but a price like that would certainly jibe with an expectation that they might sell only one unit per day per store for this model. One part of me says that’s just crazy expensive for an entertainment gadget. Another part of me says that if it really is going to cost that much, it must be much more than an entertainment device — it must be useful for some forms of work too.</p>

<p>The original Macintosh in 1984 cost $2,500 — inflation-adjusted that’s about $7,500 today. If it’s amazing, $3,000 isn’t absurd.</p>

<p>But I also keep thinking back to rumors that the original iPad was going to start at $1,000, and it instead debuted with an entry price of $500.</p>

<p>My thanks to WorkOS for sponsoring last week at DF once again. WorkOS is like “Stripe for enterprise features.” They make it easy for developers to build features needed by enterprise customers, such as Single Sign-On and SCIM.</p>

<p>Shipping these features is important because they enable selling upmarket for bigger deals. Without these features, the IT department will reject your app. But these enterprise features are complex and time-consuming to build yourself, usually taking months.</p>

<p>With WorkOS you can integrate and ship enterprise features in minutes. Beautiful API docs guide you through every step of the way, and transparent pricing scales based on usage. It’s a product built by developers, for developers.</p>

<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today unveiled Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad.
Video and music creators can now unleash their creativity in
new ways that are only possible on iPad. Final Cut Pro and
Logic Pro for iPad bring all-new touch interfaces that allow
users to enhance their workflows with the immediacy and
intuitiveness of Multi-Touch. Final Cut Pro for iPad introduces
a powerful set of tools for video creators to record, edit,
finish, and share, all from one portable device. Logic Pro for
iPad puts the power of professional music creation in the hands
of the creator — no matter where they are — with a complete
collection of sophisticated tools for songwriting, beat making,
recording, editing, and mixing. Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for
iPad will be available on the App Store as subscriptions
starting Tuesday, May 23.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both apps are priced the same: $5/month or $50/year, with a one-month free trial.</p>

<p>We’ve all been waiting for these two apps to come to iPad, and at a glance, both of them look very good. Subscription pricing is interesting, and makes me wonder if the Mac apps are going to switch to that too. And a sidenote, releasing/announcing these apps now makes me think that next month’s WWDC keynote is chockablock with other announcements.</p>

<p>WorkOS is like “Stripe for enterprise features.” They make it easy for developers to build features needed by enterprise customers, such as Single Sign-On and SCIM.</p>

<p>Shipping these features is important because they enable selling upmarket for bigger deals. Without these features, the IT department will reject your app. But these enterprise features are complex and time-consuming to build yourself, usually taking months.</p>

<p>With WorkOS you can integrate and ship enterprise features in minutes. Beautiful API docs guide you through every step of the way, and transparent pricing scales based on usage. It’s a product built by developers, for developers.</p>

<p>My thanks to Kolide for sponsoring last week at DF. Right now, “Zero Trust” is in serious danger of becoming an empty buzzword. The problem isn’t just that marketers have slapped the Zero Trust label on everything short of breakfast cereal — it’s that for all the hype, <a href="https://www.cshub.com/attacks/articles/the-biggest-data-breaches-and-leaks-of-2022">we don’t seem to be getting any safer</a>.</p>

<p>At the heart of Zero Trust is a good idea, but the way most companies execute that idea is <em>incomplete</em>. Specifically, most security practitioners forget that device compliance is a crucial element of Zero Trust. Kolide solves the device compliance element of Zero Trust for companies that use Okta. Kolide’s premise is simple: if an employee’s device is out of compliance, they can’t log in to their cloud apps until they’ve fixed the problem. And instead of creating more work for IT, Kolide provides instructions so users can get unblocked on their own.</p>

<p>Kolide works across your Mac, Windows, and even Linux devices, with mobile support coming soon. To learn more and see their product in action, <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3XlSqAq">simply visit their website</a>.</p>

<p>Joshua Kaplan, Justin Elliott, and Alex Mierjeski, reporting for ProPublica:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 2008, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas decided to send his teenage grandnephew to Hidden Lake Academy, a private boarding school in the foothills of northern Georgia. The boy, Mark Martin, was far from home. For the previous decade, he had lived with the justice and his wife in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. Thomas had taken legal custody of Martin when he was 6 years old and had recently told an interviewer he was “raising him as a son.”</p>

<p>Tuition at the boarding school ran more than $6,000 a month. But Thomas did not cover the bill. A bank statement for the school from July 2009, buried in unrelated court filings, shows the source of Martin’s tuition payment for that month: the company of billionaire real estate magnate Harlan Crow. […]</p>

<p>“You can’t be having secret financial arrangements,” said Mark W. Bennett, a retired federal judge appointed by President Bill Clinton. Bennett said he was friendly with Thomas and declined to comment for the record about the specifics of Thomas’ actions. But he said that when he was on the bench, he wouldn’t let his lawyer friends buy him lunch. […]</p>

<p>“This is way outside the norm. This is way in excess of anything I’ve seen,” said Richard Painter, former chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, referring to the cascade of gifts over the years.</p>

<p>Painter said that when he was at the White House, an official who’d taken what Thomas had would have been fired: “This amount of undisclosed gifts? You’d want to get them out of the government.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just breathtaking corruption. And Thomas’s response is basically, “Fuck you.”</p>

<p>Yours truly and Ben Thompson’s podcast — two episodes per week, 15 minutes per episode. Not a minute less, not a minute more. If you’re not listening, you’re missing out. $5/month or $50/year. We’re now in our fourth year, and we’ve had remarkably little churn — people who subscribe to Dithering tend to stay subscribed, which warms my heart. It’s a fun show and everyone loves the enforced brevity and regularity.</p>

<p>Bonus: At the end of March we started a Dithering group in <a href="https://wavelength.app/">Wavelength</a>, the new private group messaging app <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/wavelength">I started advising earlier this year</a>. It’s sort of an unofficial perk and an experiment. Subscribers can find the link to join the group in the show notes for each episode. We had no idea how this group would go, but it’s been wild. As of this typing there are over 2,900 members, and activity every day across a wide range of threads. I believe it’s the single largest group on all of Wavelength. (I just tonight told the story there of the piece of shit 2021 Kia Sorento I was bamboozled by Hertz into renting for a road trip to Boston this week, to pick my son up at the end of the college year.) It’s a nice, smart, fun little community.</p>

    <title>Ford CEO Jim Farley Seems Very Happy That GM Is Dropping CarPlay</title>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Great 3-minute clip from Joanna Stern’s interview with Ford CEO Jim Farley at the WSJ’s Future of Everything Festival. She asks him about GM’s plan to drop CarPlay from their future EVs, and Farley starts by saying “Yeah, how about that?” and laughing.</p>

<p>Farley says, “The interior has to be really well done. But in terms of content? We kind of lost that battle 10 years ago. So get real with it, because you’re not going to make a ton of money on content inside the vehicle. It’s going to be safety/security, partial autonomy, and productivity in our eyes. [...] 70 percent of our Ford customers in the U.S are Apple customers. Why would I go to an Apple customer and say ‘Good luck!’? That doesn’t seem customer centric.”</p>

<p>Farley and Ford have it exactly right. New car buyers, even from mainstream brands like Ford, are overwhelmingly iPhone users — exactly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23156741/ios-16-carplay-apple-wwdc-hvac-deeper-integration">as Apple bragged at WWDC last June</a>, and what iPhone users want in their cars is CarPlay. If anything, Farley is being kind to GM and GM CEO Mary Barra when he says their message to iPhone users is “Good luck” — it’s really more like “Fuck you.” And again, the most telling part of the whole exchange is the way Farley laughs at the start. You really have to hear it — his laugh implies a certain <em>I can’t believe our good fortune that GM is doing this.</em> It’s enough to make you think Mary Barra is a mole from Ford, planted to steer would-be Chevy buyers into Ford dealerships.</p>

<p>If you’re asking how it can be that 70 percent of Ford’s customers are iPhone users when the iPhone has maybe just over 50 percent market share in the U.S., the key is <em>new</em> car buyers. The Android masses are buying used cars, either because they don’t have the budget for a new car or because they don’t care about buying nice things (or both). So even a non-luxury brand like Ford has an overwhelming majority of customers with iPhones.</p>

<p>Richard Sandomir, writing for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Katie Cotton, who as Apple’s longtime communications chief guarded
the media’s access to Steve Jobs, the company’s visionary
co-founder, and helped organize the introduction of many of his
products, died on April 6 in Redwood City, Calif. She was 57.</p>

<p>Her death, in a hospital, was confirmed by Michael Mimeles, her
former husband. He did not give a cause but said that she had
experienced complications from heart surgery she underwent a few
years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure what took a month, but it’s a nice obituary, with quotes from Walt Mossberg, John Markoff, and other writers who covered Apple.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“She was formidable and tough and very protective of both Apple’s
brand and Steve, particularly when he got sick,” Walt Mossberg, a
former technology columnist for The Wall Street Journal, said in a
phone interview, referring to Mr. Jobs’s diagnosis of pancreatic
cancer in 2004. He added: “She was one of the few people he
trusted implicitly. He listened to her. She could pull him back
from something he intended to do or say.” Mr. Jobs died in 2011 at
56. [...]</p>

<p>“When Steve came back, he didn’t just put key engineers in place,”
Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of marketing, said.
“He put the right people in place to lead us around the company,
and Katie was a big part of that.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cotton retired from Apple almost a decade ago, but Apple’s comms still bear her mark. She built a team and a culture.</p>

<p>Rebecca Rubin, reporting for Variety:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> is officially the first film of
the year to cross the coveted $1 billion milestone at the global
box office.</p>

<p>As of Sunday, after 26 days of release, the animated video game
adaptation, from Universal, Illumination and Nintendo, has grossed
$490 million in North America and $532 million internationally.
It’s only the fifth movie of pandemic times to join the $1 billion
club, following <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em>, <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>,
<em>Jurassic World Dominion</em> and <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I realize box office numbers like this aren’t inflation-adjusted, but it’s rather incredible — no pun intended — that <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> has grossed far more than <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/brand/bn3530750466/?ref_=bo_bns_table_4">any movie from Pixar</a> (<sup>whose list is topped by <em>The Incredibles 2</em> at $600 million</sup>). This is no ding against Pixar, but simply speaks to how valuable and beloved the Nintendo character franchise is worldwide.</p>

<p>What a coup it is for Universal to score <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/super-nintendo-world-at-universal-studios-hollywood-is-officially-open-so-lets-a-go/">this partnership with Nintendo for their theme parks</a>. When comparing Universal’s parks to Disney’s, the gaping hole has always been Disney’s menagerie of beloved characters for kids — Mickey and friends, and an ever-growing list of new characters from new movies (including Pixar’s recent rich library). Universal had jack squat<sup>*</sup> for toddlers and grade schoolers. Now, they have Super Nintendo World, which like Pixar’s stuff appeals just as much to adults as it does toddlers.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> OK, my bad: my original link above was for U.S. domestic box office numbers. <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/production-company/Pixar#production_company_movies_overview=od5">Worldwide, Pixar has 4 films that have grossed over a billion</a>: <em>Incredibles 2</em>, <em>Toy Story 4</em>, <em>Toy Story 3</em>, and <em>Finding Dory</em>. My point though isn’t about which movies made the most money, but rather to assert that the Nintendo characters are <em>that</em> big of a deal. And of course it makes a ton of sense that Pixar has a few films in that rarified $1 billion box office stratosphere.</p>

<p><small>* In Orlando, Universal’s Islands of Adventure park has <a href="https://orlandoinformer.com/universal/islands-of-adventure-seuss-landing/">Seuss Landing</a>, but as much as I adore Seuss’s books, his characters don’t have anything close to the sort of appeal Disney’s and Nintendo’s do. Part of Seuss’s appeal is that his style is slightly creepy. And Universal has let that whole Seuss Landing get sun-bleached over time — it’s looked disregarded, if not almost abandoned, for years.</small></p>

<p>Off the top of my head, my single biggest complaint about Apple today is their role profiting from, and promoting, addictive pay-to-win games in the App Store. Yet simultaneously they’re building up an impressive, wide-ranging library of games that never have any in-app purchases at all with Apple Arcade. For $5/month, Apple Arcade has gone from “a pretty good deal” to “a veritable bargain”.</p>

<p>Chance Miller, reporting for 9to5Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brydge, a once thriving startup making popular keyboard
accessories for iPad, Mac, and Microsoft Surface products, is
ceasing operations. According to nearly a dozen former Brydge
employees who spoke to <em>9to5Mac</em> , Brydge has gone through
multiple rounds of layoffs within the past year after at least two
failed acquisitions.</p>

<p>As it stands today, Brydge employees have not been paid salaries
since January. Customers who pre-ordered the company’s most recent
product have been left in the dark since then as well. Its website
went <a href="https://www.brydge.com/">completely offline</a> earlier this year, and its social
media accounts have been silent since then as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whole report is a hell of a read. Impressive original reporting from Miller and his colleagues at 9to5Mac. Here’s just one gut punch among many in the story:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In December, Brydge held its annual Christmas party at a local
restaurant. [Co-CEOs] Mander-Jones and Smith had set a budget for the party,
the people said, and they stuck to that budget. At the end of the
night, one of the CEOs put his card down for the bill. His card
was declined, and a Brydge employee paid the bill instead, the
people said.</p>

<p>Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Workers at Apple Inc.’s unionized store in Maryland are asking for
higher pay and additional time off, along with changes that could
affect the company’s tightly controlled retail experience, such as
letting customers tip employees.</p>

<p>The employees, represented by the International Association of
Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, are conducting negotiations with
Apple on Wednesday and Thursday. Their latest proposal calls for
raises of as much as 10%, as well as major changes to the outlet’s
vacation policy, bereavement leave and overtime. [...]</p>

<p>The workers’ negotiators also want Apple to adopt a tipping
system, letting patrons offer gratuities in increments of 3%, 5%
or a custom amount for in-store credit-card transactions.</p>

<p>“This will allow thankful patrons the ability to express gratitude
for a job well done without any obligations,” the union wrote
Apple. “All monies collected through this manner would be
dispersed to members of the bargaining unit biweekly based on any
hours worked.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Higher pay and better vacation/holiday/leave policies are exactly the sort of things the union should ask for.</p>

<p>But this tipping proposal is so antithetical to Apple’s customer-first retail experience that it feels like a joke, or that the union negotiators have never even been in an Apple Store. They might as well ask for employees to be allowed to vape while working. Asking for something like tipping — on very expensive products, no less — plays right into the hands of those who argue that retail store unionization is not aligned with the interests of customers.</p>

<p>Stores that pay employees by commission create an obvious incentive for salespeople to pressure customers into purchasing items they don’t need or aren’t entirely comfortable with. Prompting for tips on retail sales is just a backdoor commission.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/">announced its latest quarterly results</a> on Thursday.
The company posted $94.8 billion in revenue, down slightly from
the year-ago quarter but — at least to my eyes — not down as
much as we might have expected.</p>

<p>Mac revenue was, as expected, down 31 percent to $7.2 billion — the lowest quarter of Mac revenue since 2020. iPad was down 13
percent to $6.7 billion, the lowest iPad revenue quarter since
2020. iPhone was up 2 percent to $51.3 billion, which given the
downward trend elsewhere was pretty impressive — it was a Q2
record for iPhone revenue.</p>

<p>Services revenue soared to an all-time record of $20.9 billion, up
5 percent. Wearables was down by one percent, to $8.8 billion.</p>

I thought it was interesting which shows and movies from TV+ Cook chose to highlight:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During the past quarter, fans tuned in to incredible new series
like “Shrinking” and “The Big Door Prize” and got to welcome “Ted
Lasso” back into their homes for a third season. Movies like
“Tetris” are captivating viewers with many more to come, including
Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon” later this year.</p>

<p>Three years since its launch, Apple TV+ programming has been
celebrated across the globe with over 1,450 nominations and more
than 350 wins. Recently, we were thrilled to cheer on “The Boy,
The Mole, The Fox, and The Horse,” which won an Academy Award for
Best Animated Short Film.</p>

<p>This season of our historic 10-year partnership with Major League
Soccer is well underway. With MLS Season Pass, we’ve created the
ultimate destination for soccer fans, offering subscribers the
ability to watch every match with no blackouts. And with baseball
season in full swing, Apple TV+ subscribers can watch their
favorite teams with a return of Friday Night Baseball.</p>

<p>Bobby Allyn, reporting for NPR:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an unprompted Tuesday email, Musk wrote: “So is NPR going to
start posting on Twitter again, or should we reassign @NPR to
another company?”</p>

<p>Under Twitter’s terms of service, an account’s inactivity is based
on logging in, not tweeting. Those rules state that an account
must be logged into at least every 30 days, and that “prolonged
inactivity” can result in it being permanently removed.</p>

<p>Musk did not answer when asked whether he planned to change the
platform’s definition of inactivity and he declined to say what
prompted his new questions about NPR’s lack of participation on
Twitter.</p>

<p>“Our policy is to recycle handles that are definitively dormant,”
Musk wrote in another email. “Same policy applies to all accounts.
No special treatment for NPR.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a shakedown, pure and simple. What a message to big brands and celebrities: stop posting to Twitter and they’ll reassign your longstanding username.</p>

<p>It’s bizarre that Musk thinks this might prompt NPR to start posting to Twitter again, when the only rational reaction is to feel assured that walking away from Twitter was the right move.</p>

<p>Hursh Agrawal, cofounder of The Browser Company (makers of the upstart browser <a href="https://arc.net/">Arc</a>, which for now is Mac-only):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re sprinting hard to get Arc onto Windows in 2023 — exact timing still 🤐!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His tweet has a two-minute video that outlines a tremendously ambitious plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Swift on Windows (compiler, debugger)</li>
<li>VSCode integration, Swift bindings for WinAppSDK</li>
<li>Porting Arc to Windows</li>
</ul>

<p>If they pull it off, they’ll ship a toolchain to develop cross-platform Mac/Windows apps, programmed in Swift using VSCode. I have my doubts about whether this is possible from a small team, and I have different doubts about whether this would be a good way to write good Mac apps. So I’d ignore this for now — <em>but</em> for the fact that Arc itself is very interesting, and very much real.</p>

<p>It’s not for me, but it really has a bunch of innovative, original ideas for a web browser. They’ve proven that they can ship. So I say godspeed.</p>

    <summary type="text">The decline of Windows, and slow and steady rise of Safari and the Mac.</summary>
    <content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jbenton/status/1653394051889082368">Joshua Benton on Twitter</a>, linking to <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/united-states-of-america#monthly-202201-202303">Statcounter’s U.S. browser share data for March</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the first time ever, Safari has more than 20% of desktop
browser share in the U.S.</p>

<p>Since last June, Chrome is down 6% (61.35% to 55.28%), while
Safari is up by a similar amount (15.58% to 22.3%).</p>

<p>Seems driven entirely by increased Mac market share. Over the same
span, Windows is down 14% (67.57% to 53.43%) and macOS is up 6%
(24.27% to 31.34%). ChromeOS went from 3.75% to 8.47% (though
the school year makes that comp a bit unfair).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-202201-202303">Statcounter’s latest <em>global</em> numbers</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chrome: 66.1%</li>
<li>Safari: 11.9%</li>
<li>Edge: 11%</li>
<li>Firefox: 5.7%</li>
<li>Opera: 3.1%</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking at the <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-202201-202303">global chart</a>, Chrome seems to be holding steady in the desktop market over the  last year, but Safari does show an uptick from about 9.5 to just under 11 percent. As Benton points out, the most striking thing in Statcounter’s report is the decline in Windows’s desktop OS share over the last year, both <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide#monthly-202201-202303">globally</a> and <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide#monthly-202201-202303">in the U.S.</a> I suspect Windows is losing share to <em>mobile</em> browsing just as much or more so than it is to MacOS and ChromeOS. Back when Windows had over 90 percent market share, a huge chunk of that was people who didn’t really choose a Windows PC because of Windows, but who just wanted a “computer”. They took the default, and the default computer ran Windows.</p>

<p>Nowadays, Windows still gets most of the default <em>desktop</em> market (although it seem ChromeOS continues to eat into that, especially in K-12 education). But for more and more people, their default “computer” is their phone. They might have a PC, but they use it less and less.</p>

<p>Which brings me to another real eye-opener: Statcounter’s OS market share numbers — across all devices, desktop and mobile — from 2009 until now.</p>

<p><a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share#monthly-200901-202303">Globally</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/all/united-states-of-america#monthly-200901-202303">United States</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/05/StatCounter-os_combined-US-monthly-200901-202303.png" class="noborder">
  <img

    alt = "Chart showing Statcounter's U.S. market share for operating system from January 2009 through March 2023."
  /></a></p>

<p>Globally, Windows was surpassed by Android back in 2017. The decline in Windows’s dominance has been precipitous: in 2009 Statcounter pegged its share at 95 percent; today it’s 28 percent. In the U.S., Windows is effectively neck-and-neck with iOS, each hovering around 30 percent for the last few years. It doesn’t seem outlandish to project that Mac and iOS, combined, might soon surpass Windows and Android combined in Statcounter’s share numbers for the U.S.</p>

<p>The Mac, on the other hand, is clearly seeing impressive market share growth. We all kind of knew this was true from the Mac revenue numbers <a href="https://sixcolors.com/tag/quarterly/">Apple reports each quarter</a>, but Statcounter’s data backs up Apple’s claims that the Mac continues to gain new users. And that in turn leads to more desktop Safari users — even though recent switchers strike me as among the most likely Mac users to use Chrome, which they’re likely familiar with. But if desktop Safari usage share is growing, it must mean Mac usage is growing.</p>

<p>The rise of iOS and Android as humanity’s primary computing platforms has obliterated Windows’s decades-long hegemony. To be fair, when your usage share was at one time 95 percent <em>of all web browsing</em>, there’s nowhere to go but down. But today, Windows is just one of four major platforms — and is the only one of the four that is in obvious decline, both in usage and relevance. The Mac, on the other hand, has seemingly been <em>bolstered</em> by the rise of the iPhone. We talked a lot about <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2007/10/milhouse">the “halo effect” of the iPod</a> on Mac sales in the mid-2000s, but it’s more true today with the iPhone and iPad. Mac unit sales are up and its share of desktop computing is <em>way</em> up. People who don’t care about desktop computing are just using their phones and tablets for everything; people who do care are more likely than ever to be using a Mac.</p>

<p>One more nugget, just for kicks — <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america#monthly-202201-202303">U.S.</a> and <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide#monthly-202201-202303">worldwide</a> numbers for iOS and Android in the mobile market:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th></th>
  <th>U.S.</th>
  <th>Global</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>iOS</td>
  <td>60</td>
  <td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Android</td>
  <td>40</td>
  <td>69</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>It’s also worth noting on the charts above that in hindsight, it wasn’t clear that mobile browsing would surpass desktop browsing until 2013 or 2014 — six or seven years after the debut of the iPhone. That’s a timeframe worth keeping in mind for — oh, just to pick a random up-and-coming product category — AR/VR headsets. The iPhone did change everything, but it took a while to show it outside the enthusiast / early-adopter market.</p>

<p>I knew that iOS 16 introduced support for custom domain names for iCloud+ Mail — bring your own domain name but use iCloud as your email provider and web interface. Here’s a thing I only learned today though: you can register <em>new</em> domain names right in iOS 16’s Settings app: iCloud Account → iCloud → iCloud Mail → Custom Email Domain.</p>

<p>In their support document, Apple states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A third-party registrar handles the sale of each domain. For
billing or refund issues, contact them for support.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For me (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/05/ios-16-icloud-mail-domain-registration.png">screenshot</a>) that’s Cloudflare (whose caching and SSL services I use for Daring Fireball — fantastic company). Not sure if that’s true worldwide, or if Apple has other registrar partners in other countries.</p>

<p>NYPD chief Jeffrey Maddrey, on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 21st century calls for 21st century policing. AirTags in
your car will help us recover your vehicle if it’s stolen. We’ll
use our drones, our StarChase technology and good old fashion
police work to safely recover your stolen car. Help us help you,
get an AirTag.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/01/nypd-encourages-car-owners-to-use-airtags/">Juli Clover, at MacRumors</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw72THyXsQ">press conference on Sunday</a>, New York
City mayor Eric Adams said that the city will provide 500 free
AirTags to car owners. According to <em><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/watch-mayor-adams-makes-public-safety-announcement-in-the-bronx/">CBS News</a></em> , the
AirTags are available to residents in Castle Hill, Soundview, and
Parkchester, as these areas have seen a 548 percent increase in
stolen Hyundai and Kia vehicles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a case where, ideally, you’d want FindMy (or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.trackerdetect&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Apple’s Tracker Detect app</a> for Android) <em>not</em> to notify a potential thief that they’re being tracked by an unknown-to-them AirTag. But we can’t have it both ways. There’s no magic way to mark <em>your</em> AirTag as not being used for stalking.</p>

<p>One spitball idea: Apple could license AirTag technology to be built into third-party products. With cars, they could make it part of the CarPlay system — have an AirTag integrated with the dashboard console system.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I forgot that Apple <em>does</em> license FindMy this way: <a href="https://support.vanmoof.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002192135-how-do-i-connect-my-bike-with-the-apple-find-my-network-">VanMoof e-bikes have FindMy support</a>. I was reminded of this today by a DF reader who found his stolen bike this week using it.</p>

<p>Juli Clover, reporting for MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today released Rapid Security Response (RSR) updates that
are available for iPhone and iPad users running the iOS 16.4.1
update and Mac users running macOS 13.3.1. These are the first
public RSR updates that Apple has released to date. [...]</p>

<p>iOS Security Response 16.4.1 is available through the standard
Software Update mechanism in the iPhone or iPad Settings app, but
is a quick update, requiring just a couple of minutes to download
the update and then a quick restart for the install process. The
macOS update can be installed through System Settings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve seen a few of these RSR updates while running beta versions of iOS, but I suspect those were all just tests from Apple of the RSR delivery and update mechanisms. It’s a great new mechanism for Apple, but one that they’d only use for truly significant bugs — ones they realize are being actively exploited in the wild, or could be to deeply detrimental effect.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Seems a little weird that today’s RSR updates aren’t listed yet on <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222">Apple’s security updates page</a>. In recent years Apple has been very diligent about updating this page upon the release of security updates. These new RSR updates seem to exist outside this documentation system for now.</p>

    <title>Twitter API Pricing Prompts WordPress to Drop Automated Twitter Posting</title>

<p>From the official blog of Jetpack, an official WordPress plugin from Automattic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1621026986784337922">Twitter decided</a>, on short notice, to dramatically change
the terms and pricing of the Twitter API. We have attempted to
work with Twitter in good faith to negotiate new terms, but we
have not been able to reach an agreement. As a result, the Twitter
connection on Jetpack Social will cease to work, and your blog
posts will no longer be auto-shared to Twitter.</p>

<p>You will still be able to share your posts to Twitter manually by
pasting the post link into the body of your tweet.</p>

<p>In addition, you can still auto-share your posts to Tumblr,
Facebook, and Linkedin. In the near future, we are adding the
ability to auto-share to Instagram and Mastodon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Twitter’s new API pricing is exorbitant, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-elon-musk-paid-enterprise-api-access-pricing">starting at $42,000/month for 50 million tweets</a>. I get the feeling that there are a lot of “enterprise” Twitter API users whom Elon Musk believed would definitely pay these prices, who instead are saying “<em>We are definitely</em> not <em>paying these prices</em>.” Musk thinks Twitter is indispensable. Doesn’t seem like almost anyone else does.</p>

<p>This is a perfect case: Twitter was getting far more value out of Wordpress blogs being able to auto-share new posts than vice-versa. Now those tweets just won’t go out.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here’s another good example: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nycs-transport-authority-will-no-longer-post-service-alerts-on-twitter-051701441.html">the MTA (New York’s transit authority) will no longer post status updates</a> to Twitter. If they’re not paying, who is?</p>

    <summary type="text">This situation I ran into — seeing a promotion for a three-month Apple Arcade trial despite the fact that I pay for Apple One (which includes Arcade) — is a glitch that only happened for some people who, like me, have split Apple IDs: one for iTunes and another for iCloud.</summary>
    <content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/ios_adware">Yours truly, two weeks ago</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the last several weeks, I’ve noticed <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/04/ios-settings-arcade-ad.png">an ad in Settings on my
iPhone</a>, in the iCloud section at the very top of the first
screen: “Apple Arcade Free for 3 Months”. The reason this is dumb
is that I pay for a family account for Apple One, <em>so we already
have Apple Arcade</em>. But here’s Apple badgering me to sign up for a
3-month free trial that I don’t need.</p>

<p>If I tap into that ad’s section in Settings it explains why
they’re offering it: “Services Included With Purchase”. I’m not
even sure what device I bought that earned me this offer, but it
shouldn’t matter. Why are they showing me something I already
pay for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This prompted some give-and-take with, well, <em>people familiar with the matter</em>, and I have an answer to share. The problem I was running into was a bug that resulted from the fact I have <em>split</em> Apple ID accounts: one account for iTunes and App Store purchases, and a separate account for my Apple ID. Long story short:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I created my mac.com iCloud account back in January 2000, <a href="https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/Mac.com">when Apple launched the service under the name iTools</a>. That same service was soon renamed .Mac, then MobileMe (and Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201771">changed the domain name to me.com</a>), then, finally, iCloud (and icloud.com).</p></li>
<li><p>When I signed up for my iTunes account <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/227143/15-years-of-itunes-a-look-at-apples-media-app-and-its-influence-on-an-industry.html">when the iTunes Music Store launched back in April 2003</a>, I used my primary @daringfireball.net address, not my @mac.com address. I don’t recall why I did this exactly, but I <em>think</em> that what I was thinking was something along the lines of “<em>I’m still not sure about this whole .Mac thing, but I’m pretty sure I’ll have my daringfireball.net address forever.</em>”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In hindsight, this was a mistake on my part. Everything is simpler if you only have one Apple ID that you use for both iCloud and iTunes/App Store purchases. The reason I never switched to using my mac.com iCloud account for everything, including purchases, is that there’s never been a way to migrate old purchases from a different account. And I’ve bought a lot of music, movies, and apps over the years using my other account.<sup id="fnr1-2023-05-01"><a href="#fn1-2023-05-01">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Using split accounts has always been a bit weird, occasionally problematic and/or confusing — but has mostly just worked out. It helps quite a bit that there are a <em>lot</em> of people working at Apple in the same situation. By the time the iPhone became a hit product, users new to the Apple ecosystem naturally used one address for everything. But split accounts are common from long-time Mac users, and there are a lot of long-time Mac users inside Apple.</p>

<p>This situation I ran into — seeing a promotion for a three-month Apple Arcade trial despite the fact that I pay for Apple One (which includes Arcade) — is just one of those glitches. Most Apple One subscribers don’t have split accounts, so they never saw the unnecessary promotion. And even amongst those who <em>do</em> have split accounts, they’d have to run into a certain set of circumstances to make it appear.<sup id="fnr2-2023-05-01"><a href="#fn2-2023-05-01">2</a></sup></p>

<p>So, it was a bug. And I am reliably informed that a fix is in the works that will appear in a near-future update to iOS.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>

<li id="fn1-2023-05-01">
<p>No joke, I’ve purchased 744 movies (and counting) from iTunes over the last two decades. Money runs through my fingers like water.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2023-05-01"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn2-2023-05-01">
<p>One way that it’s confusing to have multiple Apple IDs is that it’s my iCloud account — my mac.com address — that serves as the primary account for family sharing with my wife and son. But it’s my other account — my daringfireball.net address — that has made all my iTunes and App Store purchases for 23 years. That includes making the purchase to subscribe to Apple One, even though Apple One includes features like additional iCloud storage space that apply to my iCloud account. So even though I have two accounts, one for iCloud and one for purchases, Apple’s back end is somehow capable of making it all work. They are two different accounts, but my iTunes account purchases can be shared through my iCloud account’s family sharing. It sounds confusing, I know. But for the last decade or so, it really has <em>just worked</em> and I haven’t had to think about it often, other than keeping two different passwords in my head.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2023-05-01"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<p>My thanks to Atoms for sponsoring last week to promote their sweet new sneakers: a limited edition collaboration with Marques Brownlee. The mid-top Model 251 sneaker features a sleek design that blends style and comfort, paying homage to Marques’s first YouTube video — 2m:51s long — and the start of his journey as a creator. </p>

<p>They hooked me up with a pair and they are <em>nice</em>. (Where’s that chef’s kiss emoji?) Same great fit and comfort as regular Atoms, with a very distinct look. I don’t even need to tell you the colors. Available only until May 23 — check them out while they’re available.</p>

  <p>A new update for Photomator is now available, bringing a ton of
fantastic new features, changes, and improvements. But hold on,
did we say Photomator? That’s right — the app now has a snappier
and catchier new name! To complete the makeover, version 2.3 also
features a beautiful, refreshed design, but the biggest highlight
of this update lies beyond the looks.</p>

<p>We’re excited to introduce an all-new and incredibly powerful
selective adjustments feature that will completely change the way
you edit photos in Photomator. From now on, you can easily select
and edit specific areas of a photo using a variety of selections
and masks, and even make selections automatically, using AI. There
are just so many great new features in this update, so read along
if you’d like to learn all about them, and stick around till the
end for one more, very exciting announcement.</p>

<p>Just a terrific app that presses the boundaries of how good an iOS app can be.</p>

<p>Brian Sozzi, reporting for Yahoo Finance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GM told investors on Tuesday it’s looking to achieve profit
margins of more than 20% on “new businesses” by 2030. That
would be above the company’s overall 2030 operating margin goal
of 12% to 14%.</p>

<p>Pros have speculated GM could charge subscriptions for services
such as insurance by tapping into an accumulating stream of data
that it owns.</p>

<p>“It’s part of where we’re going as a company,” Jacobson added.
“Obviously data and software is a big competitive space across
the board.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The more I read about GM’s thinking, the more alarming it seems. It doesn’t seem to be about being able to provide a better experience than CarPlay, but instead about collecting surveillance data that Apple’s privacy rules don’t allow. Sozzi just breezes past this notion of using surveillance data to sell car insurance, but a car that reports such data to insurance companies seems like a privacy disaster. My insurance company doesn’t need to know how fast I drive, or where I go and when.</p>

<p>Rest of World:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s been exactly six months since Elon Musk took over Twitter,
promising a new era of free speech and independence from political
bias. But Twitter’s self-reported data shows that, under Musk, the
company has complied with hundreds more government orders for
censorship or surveillance — especially in countries such as
Turkey and India.</p>

<p>The data, drawn from Twitter’s reports to the Lumen database,
shows that between October 27, 2022 and April 26, 2023, Twitter
received a total of 971 requests from governments and courts.
These requests included orders to remove controversial posts, as
well as demands that Twitter produce private data to identify
anonymous accounts. Twitter reported that it fully complied in 808
of those requests, and partially complied in 154 other cases. (For
nine requests, it did not report any specific response.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Free speech!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This isn’t a transparency report. It’s an obfuscation report. And,
if Elon is correct that “transparency is the key to trust,” this
report suggests you shouldn’t trust Twitter one bit.</p>

beat the system. The search took me deep into a secret war between
those who make a living betting on the wheel and those who try to

British press got plenty wrong in their reports about what
happened on the night of March 15, 2004. There was no laser. But
the newspapers were right about one thing: It is possible to beat
roulette.</p>

<p>CNBC:</p>

  <p>An appeals court on Monday mostly sided with Apple over its App

Apple’s control over the App Store and the fees it charges likely

<p>Long story short, Epic has been barking up the wrong tree.</p>

  <p>Any tweet now with science, data, and facts about #climatechange

</blockquote>

<p>I think there’s a line of thought that Elon Musk had months ago ruined Twitter, but the last few days have shown that it’s gotten far worse than ever before. The main buyers of Twitter Blue are, indeed, “trolls, bots, and idiots”, and Twitter is now hardwired to prioritize tweets and replies from those accounts.</p>

<p>The blue-check accounts now are just Catturd, people who want to be Catturd, and million-plus-follower users <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/1649147510525423626">who sure as shit are <em>not</em> paying</a> for their verification status.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MIT/status/1649963039184113666">Here’s a tweet from MIT’s official account</a> that simply states a fact: “We did not subscribe to Twitter Blue.” Look at the replies. They’re all blue-check MAGA-hats.</p>

<p>Michael M. Grynbaum, John Koblin, and Benjamin Mullin, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“CNN and Don have parted ways,” Chris Licht, CNN’s chairman, said
in a statement. “Don will forever be a part of the CNN family, and
we thank him for his contributions over the past 17 years. We wish
him well and will be cheering him on in his future endeavors.”</p>

<p>That benign language contrasted sharply with Mr. Lemon’s
interpretation of the day’s events. In a scathing message on
Twitter, Mr. Lemon told viewers that he was abruptly informed by
his talent agent “that I have been terminated by CNN.”</p>

<p>“I am stunned,” Mr. Lemon wrote. “After 17 years at CNN I would
have thought that someone in management would have had the decency
to tell me directly. At no time was I ever given any indication
that I would not be able to continue to do the work I have loved
at the network.” (CNN disputed Mr. Lemon’s account, saying the
anchor “was offered an opportunity to meet with management but
instead released a statement on Twitter.”)</p>

<p>In a clear sign of acrimony, Mr. Lemon has retained the aggressive
Hollywood litigator Bryan Freedman to handle his exit. His
contract with CNN runs through 2026, according to two people with
direct knowledge of his deal.</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fox News said Monday that it was parting ways with Tucker
Carlson, its most popular prime time host who was also the
source of repeated controversies and headaches for the network
because of his statements on everything from race relations to
L.G.B.T.Q. rights.</p>

<p>The network made the announcement less than a week after it agreed
to pay $787.5 million in a defamation lawsuit in which Mr.
Carlson’s show, one of the highest rated on Fox, figured
prominently for its role in spreading misinformation after the
2020 election.</p>

<p>In making its announcement, Fox <a href="https://press.foxnews.com/2023/04/fox-news-media-and-tucker-carlson-part-ways">offered a terse statement</a>
of gratitude. “Fox News Media and Tucker Carlson have agreed to
part ways. We thank him for his service to the network as a host
and prior to that as a contributor,” it said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1650525732819423234">Aaron Rupar</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here was the end of what turned out to be Tucker Carlson’s final
Fox News show last Friday. Certainly no indication that he didn’t
expect to be on the air tonight. In fact Tucker’s final words are,
“We’ll be back on Monday.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1650533995036246016">Brian Stelter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s make one thing very clear: Tucker Carlson did not choose to
leave Fox News like this. Others can decide whether the word
“fired” applies here, but he isn’t leaving on his own terms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems like it’s unlikely to be a complete coincidence that Fox News settled the Dominion lawsuit for nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars, but odious though Carlson may be, he wasn’t really at the forefront of Fox’s election lies. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-03-09/fox-news-anchor-maria-bartiromo-dominion-defamation-suit-murdoch-trump-election-2020-carlson">Maria Bartiromo</a> and <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/judge-in-dominions-defamation-case-suggests-fox-news-has-a-lou-dobbs-problem">Lou Dobbs</a> were — and they’re both still employed at Fox.</p>

<p>Some people are speculating that it might be acquiescence to The Boss in Mar-a-Lago, after text messages uncovered in the Dominion suit revealed Carlson writing to colleagues, of Trump, “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/08/carlson-on-trump">I hate him passionately</a>.” But if Trump had a grudge against Carlson, why did he do an interview on Carlson’s show just two weeks ago?</p>

<p>Makes me think something else is going on. Maybe some sort of harassment situation? Or maybe the Murdochs figured <em>someone</em> had to be fired, and it might as well be the guy who’s too big for his britches?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The LA Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People familiar with the situation who were not authorized to
comment publicly said the decision to fire Carlson came straight
from Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch. Carlson’s exit is related
to the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-03-27/fired-fox-news-producer-said-she-was-coached-by-network-lawyers-on-defamation-case-testimony">discrimination lawsuit filed by Abby Grossberg</a>,
the producer fired by the network last month, the people said.
Carlson’s senior executive producer Justin Wells has also been
terminated, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/22/kolide">Speaking of</a> weekly sponsorships, there’s only one opening left before the end of June: next week.</p>

<p>Weekly sponsorships have been the top source of revenue for Daring Fireball ever since I started selling them <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive">back in 2007</a>. They’ve succeeded, I think, because they make everyone happy. There’s only one sponsor per week and the sponsors are always relevant to at least some sizable portion of the DF audience, so you, the reader, are never annoyed and hopefully often intrigued by them. And, from the sponsors’ perspective, they work. My favorite thing about them is how many sponsors <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive">return for subsequent weeks</a> after seeing the results.</p>

<p>If you’ve got a product or service you think would be of interest to DF’s audience of people obsessed with high quality and good design, <a href="mailto:sponsors@daringfireball.net?subject=Feed%20Sponsorship">get in touch</a>. If this quarter is a sign, the summer months will start filling up soon. And as I mentioned above, if you’ve got something to promote right now, next week is the opening left this quarter.</p>

<p>My thanks to Kolide for their continuing sponsorship support here at DF — they co-sponsored <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/03/31/ep-371">the latest episode of The Talk Show</a> that dropped last night, and they sponsored this entire week here at the website. They’re a great company with a great product.</p>

<p>Here’s an uncomfortable fact: at most companies, employees can download sensitive company data onto any device, keep it there forever, and never even know that they’re doing something wrong. Kolide’s new report, <a href="https://l.kolide.co/3I7025A">The State of Sensitive Data</a>, addresses this issue head-on.</p>

<p>Kolide offers a more nuanced approach than MDM solutions to setting and enforcing sensitive data policies. Their premise is simple: if an employee’s device is out of compliance, it can’t access your apps. Kolide lets admins run queries to detect sensitive data, flag devices that have violated policies, and enforce OS and browser updates so vulnerable devices aren’t accessing data.</p>

    <summary type="text">Anything that attempts to establish a post-phone beachhead has to do the things we love to do with our phones, or entertain us in new ways that make us forget about them. I don’t see how a laser projector on a chest badge does that.</summary>
    <content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Raymond Wong, reporting for Inverse, “<a href="https://www.inverse.com/tech/humane-ai-wearable-camera-sensor-projector-video-demo">Watch Humane’s Wearable AI Projector in Action</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Humane, the top-secret tech startup founded by <a href="https://www.inverse.com/input/tech/the-ipads-original-software-designer-and-program-lead-look-back-on-the-devices-first-10-years">ex-Apple vets
Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno</a>, just showed off the
first demo for its projector-based wearable at a TED talk.
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/04/21/humane-ai-powered-wearable">Axios’s Ina Fried broke the news</a>, and Inverse has seen a
recording of the full TED talk given by Chaudhri.</p>

<p>Journalist Zarif Ali, who had <a href="https://twitter.com/ZarifAli9/status/1649230439322664968">tweeted out an image</a> of
Humane’s wearable projecting a phone call function onto Chaudhri’s
palm, says the full TED talk video is not slated to become
available until April 22.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the full video should be out tomorrow, but in the meantime, Wong has pulled a bunch of clips. There’s some cool technology being shown, including on-the-fly translation from English to French using an AI-trained version of Chaudhri’s own voice, but what I fundamentally don’t get about Humane is their anti-phone slant. Chaudhri emphasizes that you don’t need a phone to use the unnamed Humane device, but if the device can receive and place phone calls, and has a network connection, must not their device itself be ... a phone? Just a phone in a different form factor.</p>

<p>Back in February when LeBron James broke the all-time NBA scoring title, <a href="https://twitter.com/imranchaudhri/status/1624041258778763265">Chaudhri retweeted someone</a> comparing a photo of James’s record-breaking shot (with a seeming majority of the fans in the background holding their phones to capture the moment — <a href="https://twitter.com/imranchaudhri/status/1624041258778763265">almost all of them iPhones</a>, natch) with Michael Jordan’s iconic 1998 championship-winning shot against the Utah Jazz (with, of course, not a single fan with a phone in hand).<sup id="fnr1-2023-04-21"><a href="#fn1-2023-04-21">1</a></sup> Chaudhri’s comment on the comparison: “we all deserve better.”</p>

<p>The thought being, I surmise, that Chaudhri thinks something is wrong that so many of us turn to our phones to photograph or film major moments in our lives, rather than just enjoying them through our own senses. I get it to some degree. If I’d been at that Lakers game, my phone would’ve been in my pocket at that moment, not just to absorb the actual game experience, but because I know that no photo I could take could possibly be as as good as those being taken by courtside professional sports photographers. But those thousands of fans who did have their phones out for that moment weren’t thinking “<em>This sucks, I wish I didn’t have to stare at my phone to capture this.</em>” They were thinking “<em>This is awesome and I’m glad I can capture this.</em>”</p>

<p>People take their own photos at major events not because they think those will be great photos, but because they’re proof that they were there. Selfies are the new autographs, and a shaky iPhone photo from the perspective of your own seat at the event is the new certificate of attendance.</p>

<p>We still don’t know much about Humane’s device, as Wong’s colleague at Inverse <a href="https://www.inverse.com/tech/humane-wearable-ai-projector-apps-price">Ian Carlos Campbell notes in this follow-up piece</a>. But everything we do know seems positioned around the notion of relieving us of the burden of being tethered to our iPhones all day every day. The fundamental flaw in Humane’s entire premise, as I see it, is that people don’t feel burdened by their phones. People <em>love</em> them — especially iPhone owners. And those who are ambivalent or even downright antipathetic toward their phones surely aren’t the sort of people who are interested in a newfangled laser-projecting AI-driven chest-badge computer.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/10/25/season-of-the-witch">I wrote about this all the way back in 2010</a>, in the era of the iPhone 4, when Microsoft debuted a high-budget ad campaign for their answer to the iPhone, Windows Phone 7. The ads were very entertaining — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg1gbVGk19k">particularly this one</a> — but the whole premise was fundamentally flawed. Microsoft’s message was that if you switched to Windows Phone you wouldn’t need to stare at your phone all the time. The problem is that people stare at their phones all the time not because they have to but <em>because they want to</em>.</p>

<p>“<em>Finally, you can replace this thing that you despise</em>” is a powerful marketing message. “<em>Finally, you can replace this thing that you love</em>” is not.</p>

<p>So far, it feels like Humane’s entire premise is founded on that same mistake: building a new device intended to replace our phones, without that new device being able to do any of the dozens of things we <em>love</em> to do on our phones that require a display. Apple Watch and AirPods thrive because they’re satellites to our iPhones, not ostensible replacements. Our iPhones aren’t a burden — they’re a pleasure. I’m not arguing there are no downsides to our collective mass addiction to our phones. There’s undeniably a nostalgic appeal to many aspects of the pre-iPhone age. But the notion of even a single trip to the grocery store without a phone to provide (unlimited!) material to read or watch while I wait at the checkout line seems like veritable torture to me now. Anything that attempts to establish a post-phone beachhead has to do the things we love to do with our phones, or entertain us in new ways that make us forget about them. I don’t see how a laser projector on a chest badge does that.</p>

<p>Not only are there no fans with cell phones in hand in the Jordan photo, there are none with <em>any</em> sort of camera in hand. Cell phone cameras were uncommon in 1998, but regular cameras were not. But before the iPhone age, when such policies became untenable, events like concerts and indoor sporting events banned cameras. Same thing with casinos. And even if the rules didn’t prohibit cameras, people just didn’t have the habit of taking their own photographs. Today we don’t just take photos with our phones instead of with standalone cameras — we take thousands of photos every year that we never would have taken in the first place, because we wouldn’t have had a camera with us. The best camera really is the one you have with you.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2023-04-21"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<p>Ben Smith, writing at Semafor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My old boss and partner Jonah Peretti announced today that he’s
shutting down BuzzFeed News, which we built together starting
in 2012.</p>

<p>He wrote to staff that he’d been ”slow to accept that the big
platforms wouldn’t provide the distribution or financial support
required to support premium-free journalism purpose-built for
social media.” And he wrote that he could have managed the many
business challenges that BuzzFeed has faced better.</p>

<p>The news makes me heartsick.</p>

<p>Peretti hired me in 2012 to build a news organization for the
exploding social web. For a few years, we felt the wind of
Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest at our backs, and we did
journalism that treated those sites as the front page of the new
internet. At first, we celebrated and immersed ourselves in an
optimistic web culture that imagined a reader who cared about
which Disney princess she was, and also the <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexcampbell/this-battered-woman-wants-to-get-out-of-prison">worst</a> of how
the American justice system treated abused women, who wanted to
argue about the color of <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/catesish/help-am-i-going-insane-its-definitely-blue?utm_term=.wnrMEoO6y#.agDJKQPRB">the dress</a> and also understand the
<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/virginiahughes/science-of-the-dress">science</a> behind it. That was back when all of it mixed up
in your Facebook feed, and it felt novel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>BuzzFeed News did great work and employed some terrific reporters, but they <em>never</em> had a plan to turn a profit that made any more sense than that of <a href="https://observer.com/2016/01/the-cautionary-tale-of-south-parks-underpants-gnomes/">the underwear-collecting gnomes</a> on <em>South Park</em>.</p>

<p>Ina Fried, reporting for Axios:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ex-Apple employee Imran Chaudhri gave TED attendees on Thursday an
early glimpse of the AI-powered wearable that his startup, Humane,
has been developing. [...]</p>

<p>The screenless device, which does not require a nearby cell phone
to work, uses a combination of voice and gestures for input and
can display information by projecting it onto nearby objects.</p>

<p>Details: In his TED talk, Chaudhri showed the wearable, which sat
in his jacket pocket, translating his own voice into French.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He also answered a phone call from his wife with the call
information appearing as a green image projected onto his hand.</p></li>
<li><p>“This is good AI in action,” he said, promising more details
would be released in the coming months.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The device — which seemingly doesn’t yet have an announced name? — looks about 2 inches wide and 1 inch high, and is worn on your chest like a Star Trek communicator badge. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/04/humane-ted-bethany-is-calling.jpeg">Here’s an image of the phone call information projected onto Chaudhri’s hand</a>. Hope the whole demo is released on video soon.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Actually, now that I look at the video clips that are available, I think the device is quite a bit bigger, and Chaudhri has it peeking out of a pocket on his jacket? Unclear.</p>

    <summary type="text">Promotions for services I might want? Maybe, but Apple should be extremely conservative about presenting them — especially in push notifications. Promotions for services I already pay for? That shouldn’t happen.</summary>
    <content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://stevestreza.com/2020/02/17/ios-adware/">Steve Streza, all the way back in February 2020</a> (innocent times, that month):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the years, Apple has built up a portfolio of services and
add-ons that you pay for. Starting with AppleCare extended
warranties and iCloud data subscriptions, they expanded to Apple
Music a few years ago, only to dramatically ramp up their
offerings last year with TV+, News+, Arcade, and Card. Their
services business, taken as a whole, is quickly becoming massive;
Apple reported <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/28/apple-services-revenue-12-7-billion-q1-2020/">$12.7 billion in Q1 2020</a> alone, nearly a
sixth of its already gigantic quarterly revenue. [...]</p>

<p>If you don’t subscribe to these services, you’ll be forced to look
at these ads constantly, either in the apps you use or the push
notifications they have turned on by default. The pervasiveness of
ads in iOS is a topic largely unexplored, perhaps due to these
services having a lot of adoption among the early adopter crowd
that tends to discuss Apple and their design. This isn’t a value
call on the services themselves, but a look at how aggressively
Apple pushes you to pay for them, and how that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking">growth-hack</a>-style design comes at the expense of the user
experience. In this post, I’ll break down all of the places in iOS
that I’ve found that have Apple-manufactured ads. You can
replicate these results yourself by doing a factory reset of an
iPhone (backup first!), installing iOS 13, and signing up for a
new iCloud account.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Streza’s post emphasizes the new-user experience, and he’s right that longtime users (like you, dear reader, probably) don’t see a lot of this. But I do, because when reviewing new devices or new OS releases, I’ll sometimes set up as new (and use a spare Apple ID dedicated to testing) to see the factory-fresh Cupertino default experience. Is it too much advertising? I don’t know — but it’s a lot. One thing that’s clear is that Apple sees Music and TV as Apple-service properties. Yes, you can use them for listening to your own music and watching your own video files, but first and foremost these are client apps to Apple’s Music and TV+ services. These are not the iTunes and Video apps of yore.</p>

<p>But what got me thinking about this issue this week is the dumbest adware in iOS I’ve seen. For the last several weeks, I’ve noticed <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/04/ios-settings-arcade-ad.png">an ad in Settings on my iPhone</a>, in the iCloud section at the very top of the first screen: “Apple Arcade Free for 3 Months”. The reason this is dumb is that I pay for a family account for Apple One, <em>so we already have Apple Arcade</em>. But here’s Apple badgering me to sign up for a 3-month free trial that I don’t need.</p>

<p>If I tap into that ad’s section in Settings it explains why they’re offering it: “Services Included With Purchase”. I’m not even sure what device I bought that earned me this offer, but it shouldn’t matter. Why are they showing me something I already pay for?</p>

<p>To be clear, I was able to make this ad go away by tapping “Not Now” on the offer screen in Settings. (I waited for weeks before doing so to see if it would go away on its own.) And I’m not blankly opposed to using this top-of-the-first-screen space in Settings to show offers for Apple’s services or AppleCare warranty coverage. But they ought to be presented conservatively, and with surgical precision. Apple is doing users a favor if they’re reminding them of offers — like three free months of Apple Arcade — that they’ve already qualified for with a hardware purchase. But it’s annoying and confusing that it’s the very app where I manage my Apple One subscription that’s suggesting I sign up for a service included in Apple One.</p>

<p>We — including Apple itself and Tim Cook personally — decry the invasiveness of the surveillance advertising complex, by which they develop profiles of us so accurate that the ads they deliver are so on-point to our recent interests that millions of people falsely believe their devices are somehow surreptitiously listening to their real-world conversations. This stupid Apple Arcade prompt in Settings is the opposite: I’m being shown it because Apple knows I recently bought a new device from them, but somehow doesn’t know that I already pay them for a subscription that includes Arcade. How can they be so contextually unaware?</p>

<p>Promotions for services I might want? Maybe, but Apple should be extremely conservative about presenting them — especially in push notifications. Promotions for services I already pay for? That shouldn’t happen.</p>

<p><strong>Postscript, two weeks later:</strong> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/05/followup_on_apple_services_ad">This bug was triggered by the fact that I’m an edge case, with separate Apple IDs for iCloud and for iTunes/App Store purchases</a>.</p>

    <summary type="text">HBO’s new slogan might as well be “It’s not TV. It’s a tab somewhere in the Max app.”</summary>
    <content type="html" xml:base="https://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/warner-bros-discovery-unveils-max-streaming-service">Warner Bros. Discovery</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Warner Bros. Discovery today introduced Max, its enhanced
streaming service, which will launch in the U.S. on May 23. Max is
the destination for HBO Originals, Warner Bros. films, Max
Originals, the DC universe, the Wizarding World of Harry Potter,
an expansive offering of kids content, and best-in-class
programming across food, home, reality, lifestyle and
documentaries from leading brands like HGTV, Food Network,
Discovery Channel, TLC, ID and more. Max will stand out amongst
streamers by uniquely combining unrivaled breadth and superior
quality with iconic franchises and strong product experience, all
for great value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would argue the opposite: that by cramming their entire disparate gamut of brands into a single service, none of them stand out, and the Max brand stands for nothing.<sup id="fnr1-2023-04-12"><a href="#fn1-2023-04-12">1</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Max will offer three pricing options, giving subscribers the
choice to select which plan best fits the needs of their
household.</p>

<ul>
<li>Max Ad-Lite — $9.99/month or $99.99/year <br />
2 concurrent streams, 1080p resolution, no offline downloads,
5.1 surround sound quality</li>
<li>Max Ad Free — $15.99/month or $149.99/year <br />
2 concurrent streams, 1080 resolution, 30 offline downloads, 5.1 surround
sound quality</li>
<li>Max Ultimate Ad Free — $19.99/month or $199.99/year <br />
4 concurrent streams, up to 4K UHD resolution, 100 offline
downloads, Dolby Atmos sound quality</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>These prices are pretty much the same as <a href="https://www.netflix.com/signup/planform">Netflix’s</a>, except that Netflix’s “basic with ads” tier (it’s adorable that Max is calling theirs “ad-lite”) is $7/month and, criminally, still limited to 720p resolution. <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/disney-hulu-espn-bundle">Disney+</a> currently offers two plans: $8/month with ads, or $11/month without (and with offline downloads). Disney+ also offers bundles with Hulu and ESPN+: $13/month with ads, $20/month without. Apple TV+ — with a growing but admittedly boutique-sized library compared to Max, Netflix, and Disney/Hulu — is $7/month, and has no tier with ads.</p>

<p>When this “Max” name truncation was first rumored in December, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/12/06/cnbc-warner-max">I wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not the worst name they could go with. The mistake with “HBO Max”
was muddying the premium HBO brand with the “anything and
everything” content of a unified app for everything this enormous
content factory conglomerate puts online. My big question is what
happens to HBO content. Is it stuck in a tab inside the “Max” app,
or will there be a standalone “HBO” app too?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks like HBO is now just a brand inside the Max service. They’re ceding the “everything you get on this service is premium content, and there are no ads” ground to Apple TV+. HBO is still HBO on cable, but as the world inexorably moves to an all-streaming future, this feels like “corporate synergy” run amok. The non-HBO content in HBO Max already diluted the brand; now they’re putting even more non-premium content (all the Discovery crap) into the same app. (Today’s New York Times headline says it all: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/11/business/media/max-streaming-warner-hbo.html">‘Succession’ and ‘Dr. Pimple Popper’ Together in New Warner Streaming App</a>”.)</p>

<p>Disney set the example Warner Bros. Discovery should have followed, with Disney+ and Hulu as separate apps, but priced together in a bundle. Disney isn’t relegating Disney+ content into a mere tab in the Hulu app, nor are they allowing Hulu’s content to dilute the prestigious Disney brand in the Disney+ app.</p>

<p>They obviously think they’ve being clever with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/04/max-logotype.jpeg">the Max logotype</a> having a dot inside the “a”, evoking the “o” in HBO’s, but I find it just sad — the bastardization of an iconic mark. Either Max stands on its own, independent of HBO, or HBO should be <em>the</em> brand for HBO content.</p>

<p>HBO’s old slogan was “It’s not TV. It’s HBO”. That slogan captured HBO’s prestige: unedited major motion pictures, best-of-breed original content, all without commercial interruptions. HBO’s new slogan might as well be “It’s not TV. It’s a tab somewhere in the Max app.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1-2023-04-12">
<p>The nomenclatural trend <em>du jour</em> for subscription services is to take your company’s existing well-known brand and tack on a suffix like <em>plus</em>, <em>max</em>, or <em>one</em>. Hence: Disney+, ESPN+, Paramount+, Apple TV+, Apple One, Google One — <a href="https://www.canalplus.com/">even Canal+ in France</a>. I think that’s what Warner was going for with the “Max” in HBO Max. So in some sense going with just plain “Max” makes no more branding sense than if Disney+ or Paramount+ had been named just “Plus”. But for those of you my age or older, <em>Max</em> also brings to mind Cinemax — Warner’s longtime cable-pay-channel sibling to HBO. Premium and commercial-free, like HBO, but clearly not <em>as</em> premium. HBO is <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/dimagjo01.shtml">Joe DiMaggio</a>; Cinemax is <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/dimagdo01.shtml">Dom DiMaggio</a>. HBO is the home of hall-of-fame groundbreaking original series like <em>The Sopranos</em>, <em>The Wire</em>, <em>The Larry Sanders Show</em>, <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>, <em>Game of Thrones</em>, and <em>Succession</em>. Cinemax is the home of ... <a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls567109928/">checks notes</a> ... <em>Banshee</em>, <em>The Knick</em>, <em>Warrior</em>, and <em>Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus</em>. Cinemax’s biggest claim to fame from my teenage years is that after a certain hour, they showed movies that earned them the nickname “<a href="https://screencrush.com/rip-skinemax/">Skinemax</a>”. (Sleepovers were always preferably held at the homes of Cinemax subscribers.)</p>

<p>No matter what Warner Bros. Discovery intends “Max” to mean, it feels damn stupid to lean even vaguely on Cinemax, and not at all on HBO, as a brand name.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2023-04-12"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>
